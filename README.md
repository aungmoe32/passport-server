### Workflow Overview

1.  **Login Button Click** (Passport-Client):

    - User clicks the "Login as Passport-Server" button on the Passport-Client login page.
    - The client redirects the user to the Passport-Server's authorization endpoint, including a query string with the **client ID**, **redirect URI**, and **scope**.

2.  **Authenticate on Passport-Server**:

    - If the user is **not already logged in** on Passport-Server, they are prompted to log in (e.g., email and password form).
    - Once logged in, Passport-Server asks for user consent (if applicable) to share their profile with Passport-Client.

3.  **Authorization Code Issued**:

    - Upon successful login and consent, Passport-Server redirects the user back to the Passport-Client's **redirect URI**, along with an **authorization code**.

4.  **Authorization Code Exchanged for Token**:

    - Passport-Client sends the authorization code, along with its client ID and client secret, to Passport-Server's token endpoint.
    - If valid, Passport-Server responds with an **access token** (and optionally a refresh token).

5.  **User Logged In**:

    - Passport-Client uses the access token to fetch the user profile from Passport-Server's user info endpoint.
    - Passport-Client creates a session for the user, completing the login process.

## Features

#### On Passport-Server:

- OAuth 2.0 authentication services for secure login.
- A **Posts** section for users to write and manage their content.
- A **Dashboard** to manage users, clients, and tokens.
- Ability to **revoke client tokens** for enhanced security and control.

#### On Passport-Client:

- Integration with Passport-Server for seamless user authentication.
- A **Products** section for users to manage product listings.

## Implementations

- **Laravel Filament** : Using Laravel Filament to provide an elegant admin interface for managing OAuth clients, users, and tokens.

#### On Passport-Server:

- **Authorization Endpoint**: Validates the client, authenticates the user, and issues an authorization code.
- **Token Endpoint**: Exchanges the authorization code for an access token.
- **User Info Endpoint**: Provides user details when queried with a valid access token.

#### On Passport-Client:

- **Login Flow**: Initiates the OAuth flow by redirecting to Passport-Server.
- **Callback Handling**:
  - Processes the authorization code and retrieves the access token.
  - Uses the token to fetch user details and establish a session.

## Challenges

1.  **Token Security**: Ensuring the secure storage and handling of tokens on both server and client sides.
2.  **OAuth Flow Complexity**: Implementing and debugging the complete OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow.
3.  **User Experience**: Maintaining a seamless user experience during redirections between Passport-Client and Passport-Server.
4.  **Token Revocation**: Properly handling token revocation and ensuring affected sessions are invalidated.
5.  **Admin Panel Customization**: Adapting Laravel Filament for specialized management tasks like token monitoring and user actions.

User ->> passport-client:  user clicks login as <br> passport-server

passport-client ->> User : to redirect passport-server <br>(/oauth/authorize)<br> with params

User ->> passport-server: (/oauth/authorize) with <br> client ID, redirect URI, <br> scope params.


passport-server ->> User: ask User to enter credentials <br> and permissions to give access scope

User ->> passport-server : User gives credentials


passport-server ->> passport-client: send back authorization code <br> to client using redirect-url <br> (/callback?code=...)

passport-client ->> passport-server: request access token with <br> client_id, client_secret, <br> grant_type, and authorization code


passport-server ->> passport-client: send back <br> access token and refresh token <br> if client_id, client_secret,<br> and authorization code valid


passport-client ->> passport-server: request user info with <br> access token


passport-server ->> passport-client: send back user info <br> if access token valid

passport-client ->> User : show logged in <br> user info
